# react-project-starter
Write and deploy a React project from scratch without using create-react-app

- This repo's default branch is `main`
- The `tailwindcss` branch is used for trying out tailwindcss.
- The deployed version is at https://kexizeroing.github.io/react-project-starter/ using Github Pages.

*Update in the end of 2022:*  
I used to use create-react-app but these days I use Vite. It’s not a React-specific tool, so it can be ported to other frameworks like Svelte and Vue, too. Run `npm create vite@latest`, choose a framework and pick “React”.
